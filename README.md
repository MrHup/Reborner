# Reborner
An unfinished platformer built for Android and iOS devices.

I used _box2d_ for collisions and the levels are entirely generated based on input given in the matrix file. The idea was to make a puzzle type game that required positioning of the character and multiple tries to solve a level. The project was abandoned due to some personal problems and I haven't revisited it since.
